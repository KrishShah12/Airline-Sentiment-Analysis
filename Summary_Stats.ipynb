    "The statistical analysis aimed to extract insights from the flight reviews dataset to enhance understanding of passenger experiences and sentiments. It began by summarizing key statistics such as ratings distribution, sentiment polarity, and the percentage of recommended flights. The analysis then identified top-performing airlines, areas for improvement, and characteristics of review lengths. Overall, the objective was to provide actionable insights to help airlines improve services, boost customer satisfaction, and inform decision-making processes to optimize the passenger experience."

    "1. **Skewed Distribution**: The distribution of ratings appears to be heavily skewed towards lower ratings, as indicated by the relatively low mean compared to the median and the high standard deviation. This suggests that a significant proportion of reviewers may have had negative experiences or provided lower ratings.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **Potential Issues**: The presence of a large number of low ratings, as indicated by the 25th percentile being 1, may signal potential issues or areas for improvement in the flight experiences provided by the airlines."
